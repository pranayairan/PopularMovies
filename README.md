# Popular Movies
Popular movies was done as part of udacity android devloper nanodegree course, this application queries movie db api 
to find popular movies and display them in nice material design ui. User can go a detaild down on each movie, getting critics 
reviews, ratings and watch trailers on youtube. 

This app helped me in understanding concepts like async tasks, network communication, parsing data in json, using intents to 
open android app and material design basics.
